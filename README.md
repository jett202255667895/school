This is a website that i made for one of my school projects after this school project i def will not use it anymore feel free to fork it and stuff idrc any bugs or stuff will not be fixed this is the last
day of me fixing the website with all of the bugs and stuff all together it was a fun 8 week project and i wont use it anymore so if you wanna make your own store use this templete if you want fyi payment.html is 
fake and wont work also i dont collect any data in this website all the info you feel out in the form is lost and is not kept one bit the contact.html does not work either overall with all the fake stuff you would 
need to put alot of effort in to make it real but apart from that in the future i might make somemore cool projects for anyone i wanna be a known dev but thats just a dream but i hope you enjoy this website
and me yaping for like 10 years in a row hope you enjoy :)
